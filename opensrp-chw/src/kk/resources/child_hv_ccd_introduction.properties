  \n\nA newborn baby can see things, feel things, and can respond to the voices and sounds she or he hears. A baby can tell us she or he is hungry or unhappy by the sounds he makes. A baby loves to see faces of her or his mum and dad (or other important caregivers).\
  \n\nThe more opportunities we give our babies to explore the world (by playing, practicing new skills, seeing new things and copying what others do), the more information is given to the brain of the baby!"

  \n Say "We will start from this week onward with activities for you to interact and provide stimulation to your child. We will do this because: \
  \n• Children’s development in the first 3 years is very important: it affects how well the child does at school, how well they behave and their success as an adult\
  \n• The brain is developing very fast at this time and what happens to the child – love, play, care, nutrition and health – affects how the brain develops\
  \n• Adults looking after the child can change how the child develops. They can affect how smart the child will be, how they behave, how they relate to others and how happy they are.\
  \n Therefore in the coming weeks and months, we will continue doing what we will do today: talking about your child's behavior and development and conducting activities corresponding to \
  \nyour child's age. The goal is that you continue stimulating your child and that the things we do together will give you some ideas! Remember: This is an important time in their \
  life because the way they will grow and learn depends very much on behaviors that you (and other adults) show to your child."
